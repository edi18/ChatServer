# ChatServer

C# chat console server (default port is 27015), asynchronus with blocking TCP/IP stream sockets and a thread pool provided by the .Net framework.

Basic logging of client connection, disconnection and sent messages.

Client app is basic winform GUI, with a small bug, login form will not close and can't be reused sometimes so shut down complete app before testing again.
