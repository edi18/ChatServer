# ChatServer

C# chat console server (default port is 27015), asynchronus with blocking TCP/IP stream sockets and a thread pool provided by the .Net framework.

Basic logging of client connection, disconnection and sent messages.

Client app is basic winform GUI, with small bug, login form won't close and can't be reused sometimes so shut down complete app before testing again.
